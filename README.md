# BBC-Sport-Clone
 HTML/CSS BBC Sport Clone: Pretty much using doing this project to properly learn HTML/CSS as even though I did it in A-level and GCSE never really fully learnt it as I didn't care at the time so I just focused on learning the bare minimal to get the marks I needed for the test that involved it. With that being said may or may not complete this clone to it's entirety as the BBC Sports website is quite large and I want to learn other languages but we will see.
