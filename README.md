# BBC-Sport-Clone
### HTML/CSS/JavaScript BBC Sport Clone 

**Description:** Pretty much using doing this project to properly learn HTML/CSS as even though I did it in A-level and GCSE never really fully learnt it as I didn't care at the time but now I do as I want to be jack of all trades in as many programming languages (if you deem HTML/CSS as one). With that being said my secondary focus for this project is to use it to learn Javascript as I will be needing it to move onto ReactJS which I need for my second year university modules.
