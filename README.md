# BBC-Sport-Clone
 HTML/CSS/JavaScript BBC Sport Clone: Pretty much using doing this project to properly learn HTML/CSS as even though I did it in A-level and GCSE never really fully learnt it as I didn't care at the time so I just focused on learning the bare minimal to get the marks I needed for the test that involved it. With that being said my secondary focus for this project is to use it to learn Javascript as I will be needing it to move onto ReactJS which I need for my second year university project.
